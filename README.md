## Wireframes
For the wireframes i used a tool called [marvelapp](https://marvelapp.com/). It is simple and understanding and it gave the feeling of simplicity when it came to drawing the wireframes , because it made the drawing and the overall look of using the tool easy without any complications. It wasn't to find what i was looking for since they had lots of of different alternatives.

View my wireframes for different screen sizes to be more specific:

- Desktop Wireframes

- Tablet Wireframes

- Mobile Wireframes
